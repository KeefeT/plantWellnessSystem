Sensor microcontroller
ESP32
see: https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32

Will poll sensors for data and send them wirelessly to hub
This SoC seems to be a good tool for what we want to do
We can write Rust for this !!!! (Thank you Ethan)
(Or C if we wanted to be boring)


Sensors

Let's start with:
Barometer
Thermometer
Photosensor
Soil Moisture sensor

For future, soil PH sensor (?)[need research], humidity 

To start we'll probably just want to get this all working on a bread board before soldering everything together, could consider 3D printing a case



Hub
Raspberry Pi

Will collect data from sensors and post them to database
See: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/

Maybe need to find a different solution for this; we don't *need* to have a whole OS running for this but it would make things a little easier for us initially

Probably want to write everything in Python for this to make it easy to do the http requests + native support



DB / Server

No idea how this is gonna work yet, probably want to get the sensor SoC to send data back to the hub before we worry about this


App

Android would probably be easier to start out with than iOS
We could do a website too but let's make that a stretch goal
